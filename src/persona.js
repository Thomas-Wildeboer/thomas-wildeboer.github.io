    story: "I develop computational approaches to answer questions in evolutionary genetics as a graduate student at the University of Toronto. Primary foci are bridging between micro- and macroevolutionary theory and the use of large-scale, individual-based simulations to understand the evolution of complex traits. I am also generally interested in software development and high performance computing.",
